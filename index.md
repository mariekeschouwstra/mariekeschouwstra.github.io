Humans use complex expressions to convey complex meanings, a trait that is unique to our species. Having a background in formal semantics (Montague grammar and dynamic semantics) and philosophy of language, I am interested in how (complex) meaning is best characterised. My current research focuses on language evolution, and shows that concepts from semantic theory and philosophy of language can be successfully applied to gain insight in the evolutionary origins of complex language.

One of the methodologies I use are laboratory experiments in which adult participants improvise to convey information. For example, in **silent gesture** experiments, participants describe events using only their hands and no speech.

I am interested in how the preferences that surface in *improvisation* change under the influence of cultural evolutionary mechanisms, like *communicative interaction* and *iterated learning*. I showed that in improvisation, participants prefer to structure constituents in such a way that the structure of the utterance mirrors the semantic structure of the information to be conveyed. See for instance my paper in Cognition, which focuses on intensional and extensional verbs, and my paper in Cognitive Science, which focuses on temporal structure.

Moreover, I showed that both interaction and iterated learning can lead to conventionalisation and regularisation of word order (see my recent Evolang paper). My goal is to study how we get from one-to-one form/meaning mappings to system-wide generalisations in newly emerging communication systems in the lab.

Being able to witness these processes at play in the lab is exciting and informative. At the same time, I am convinced that we should not restrict our view to laboratory data alone (Schouwstra, 2012). Combining the precision of laboratory experiments with the naturalness of field data is a promising next step in uncovering the cultural processes that shape emerging language.
