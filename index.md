## Origins of complex meaning

Humans use complex expressions to convey complex meanings, a trait that is unique to our species. I am interested in how complex meaning is best characterised, and how it came about. 

## Starting froms scratch: improvisation 

One of the methodologies I use are laboratory experiments in which adult participants improvise to convey information. For example, in **silent gesture** experiments, participants describe events using only their hands and no speech. See my papers in [Cognition](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714000432), [Cognitive Science](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12441/full), and [another paper in Cognitive Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12732?casa_token=vD9l93ny4d0AAAAA%3A_Pi5_tQ1ZWxppY2eBsZGUt3-Q4Am9XQrDPgYmO-RIOGxiIqXBYLeQT7CnMKA3N3mka83ZWulGDrTIA). 

## Evolving a communication system in the lab

I am interested in how the preferences that surface in *improvisation* change under the influence of cultural evolutionary mechanisms, like *communicative interaction* and *iterated learning*. See this [Evolang paper](http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/24545060/SCHOUWSTRA_etal_2016_ELPIC_FROM_NATURAL_ORDER_TO_CONVENTION.pdf) and [this paper in Cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719301234) by my phd student [Yasamin Motamedi](https://ymotamedi.github.io/).

## Watching a language emerge

Being able to watch two individuals create a new language from scratch has changed my thinking in important ways. See [this blog post](https://www.ayearofconversation.com/blog/conversation-without-words) on my experiences in the lab.
